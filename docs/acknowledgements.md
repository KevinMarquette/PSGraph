I want to thank everyone that has submitted feedback,ideas and contributions to this project. There are a few people that I need to call a special thank you out to.

# Warren 'Cookie Monster' Frame
I modeled this project very closely after some of his community projects. In many cases, I used large chunks of his build and deployment scripts. I am sure I could have written my own, but I was able to just drop his scripts into my project. Because of that, I was able to auto publish to the Powershell Gallery with no effort.

# Doug Finkle
When I first brought up the idea for this module, he pointed me to work that had already been done in this area. It was covered in his book [Powershell for Developers](http://amzn.to/2kGzj6c). In the example code for chapter 9, he showed me a creative way to approach generating graphs. That was the corner stone for how I approached the rest of this module.
