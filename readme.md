# What is Graphviz?

Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics,  software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains. 

# What is PSGraphViz?
A set of powershell commands to easier to generate GraphViz graphs on the fly.

# Project status?
Brand spankin new. I am still flashing out ideas on how I want to approach this module. Consider it unstable and highly likely to change quite a bit.
