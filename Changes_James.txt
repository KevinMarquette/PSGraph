Added examples.docx and  graphvizAttributes.xlsx in docs

Changed Record.ps1 Adding a TitleSpan parameter and making TableStyle, Fontname, FillColor, and TitlePosition into parameters-with-defaults instead of constants.
Changed node.ps1   Adding parameters Shape and Label
Changed edge.ps1   Adding parameters Label, Style and Direction 
                   and allowing parameters To, From, Label, Style and Direction to be properties of objects passed from the pipeline. 
                   This required moving the setting of attributes from the begin block into process block (multiple items couldn't be piped in before).

Added new commands (explained in examples.docx)
        cells 
        New-NodeAttributeSet
        New-EdgeAttributeSet
        svg as an all in one to call graph and then export-PSGraph. Depending on the name used to call it it will change the format passed to Export-PSGraph  
        Added Global aliases for xxxGraph --> svg . 

Changed Get-Translated argument so if parameter value is null or empty no paramter is created.
Changed Export-PsGraph so that Destinationpath resolved from a partial path (but not a null or empty one)
(Net effect of these two changes is calling with -Destinationpath "" doesn't path an output path to graphviz and output goes to std out)
Changed Export-PsGraph so graphviz output is put into a variable instead of null, and this variable is returned if DestinationPath is empty.
